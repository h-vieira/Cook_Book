    "instruction": " Melt butter in a pan (or in a pyrex cup in the microwave) and add to milk. Check the temperature... it should be around 110-115 degrees Fahrenheit (hotter will kill the yeast, colder won't activate it) Stir in the Sugar Stir in the dried yeast. Let sit for 5 minutes until it begins to bubble so you know the yeast is active. Sift flour into a mixing bowl. Pour in the milk/butter/yeast mixture. Add the vanilla, salt and eggs. Mix to combine into a sticky dough. Then Knead (by hand or with a dough hook) for 5 minutes. Put the kneaded dough into a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and set in a warm place to rise. It will take about an hour, and will double in size. When dough is doubled...Lightly flour the counter, then take the dough out of the bowl, and knead it a few times. (Just pat it down, and give it a few kneads to wake it back up) Roll the dough about 1/2 inch thick Here is where you make a choice. I didn't have a smaller round cutter, so I cut mine with a glass. The glass was closer to 4 inches across, so I had BIG Berliner. Not really tragic, it just made fewer, and I had to cook them a few seconds longer. Cut out your rounds of dough, and place them on a cookie sheet. Re-roll the scraps and cut rounds out of the last bits (no waste!). These ones might look funny, so they are great for double checking cooking time! Cover the dough circles with a towel, and leave to rise for 30 minutes",

    "instruction": "Spread the beef slices out on a large cutting board. Brush each slice with 1 teaspoon mustard and season with salt and pepper. Top each slice with 2 slices of bacon or pork belly. Peel and quarter the onion. Cut one quarter into four thick slices and place a slice of onion on each piece of meat. Top it with a gherkin. Finely chop the rest of the onion and distribute it over the meat pieces. Tightly roll the pieces up from the shortest side; secure the roll-ups with wooden toothpicks. Heat oil in a wide pan or pot; add the roll-ups and brown on all sides. Add enough stock to cover the roll-ups. Stir in 2 tablespoons mustard, chopped tomato, onion and red pepper. Bring to the boil; reduce heat to low and cook, covered, for 90 minutes. Turn the roll-ups over every so often. At the end of the cooking time, remove them from the pot and keep warm. Pour the sauce through a fine sieve into a saucepan. Discard the solids and bring sauce to the boil. Dilute 1 to 2 tablespoons cornflour in a few tablespoons cold water and whisk it into the sauce. Cook, whisking, until the sauce thickens. Season to taste with salt and pepper, adding more mustard or tomato puree if needed. When the sauce is to your liking, return the roll-ups to the pan and heat through before serving.",
